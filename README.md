# **Fossil Math by Fossil Logic**

**Fossil Math** is a lightweight, cross-platform mathematics library written in pure C with zero external dependencies. Designed for high-performance computation, embedded systems, and cross-platform applications, Fossil Math provides a robust set of functions for linear algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and numerical analysis, all optimized for efficiency and portability.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Runs reliably on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded platforms.

- **Zero External Dependencies**  
  Pure C implementation ensures maximum portability, auditability, and ease of integration.

- **Comprehensive Math Functions**  
  Includes linear algebra, vectors, matrices, quaternions, trigonometry, and other numerical utilities.

- **Lightweight and Efficient**  
  Optimized for performance with minimal resource usage, suitable for embedded and low-power devices.

- **Precision and Reliability**  
  Provides stable and accurate numerical results for high-precision calculations.

- **Modular Design**  
  Easily integrated into projects, with optional modules for advanced math features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Meson Build System**  
  Fossil Math uses Meson for build configuration. If you don’t have Meson installed, follow the instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

### Adding Fossil Math as a Dependency

#### Using Meson

### **Install or Upgrade Meson** (version 1.3 or newer recommended):

```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # Install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # Upgrade Meson
```
###	Add the .wrap File
Place a file named fossil-math.wrap in your subprojects directory with the following content:

```ini
# ======================
# Git Wrap package definition
# ======================
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-math.git
revision = v0.1.0

[provide]
fossil-math = fossil_math_dep
```

###	Integrate in Your meson.build
Add the dependency by including this line:

```meson
math_dep = dependency('fossil-math')
```


## Build Configuration Options

Customize your build with the following Meson options:
	•	Enable Tests
To run the built-in test suite, configure Meson with:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```
